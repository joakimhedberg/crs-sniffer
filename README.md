## Available Scripts  

### `yarn start`  
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.  

The page will reload when you make edits, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.  

### `yarn test`  
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.  

### `yarn build`  
Builds the app for production and outputs it to the `build` folder.  
The build is optimized for the best performance—minified and with hashed filenames.  

Your app is now ready for deployment!  
See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.  

### `yarn eject`  
⚠️ **Warning: This is a one-way operation!**  

If you need full control over the build configuration, you can `eject`. This will copy all dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, removing the single build dependency.  

Once you `eject`, you cannot undo this action. However, for most projects, the default configuration should be sufficient.
